# Question 1
### Difference between Array and ArrayList?
<blockquote>
<p>1. <code>Array</code> is strongly typed and can store only same type of data while <code>ArrayList</code> can store any type of data.</p>
<p>2. <code>Array</code> stores fixed number of elements while <code>ArrayList</code> can store any number of elements as it grows dynamically.</p>
<p>3. In <code>Array</code> no need to cast elements while retrieving whereas in <code>ArrayList</code> items need to be cast to appropriate data type while retrieving.</p>
</blockquote>

# Question 2
### Difference between String and StringBuilder?
<blockquote>
<p>1. <code>String</code> is immutable i.e. if we create a string object then we can't modify it & it always creates new object of string type in memory while <code>StringBuilder</code> is mutable i.e. if we create StringBuilder object then we can perform any operation like insert, replace or append without creating new instance every time.</p>
<p>2. <code>String</code> belongs to System class while <code>StringBuilder</code> belongs to System.Text class.</p>
</blockquote>

# Question 3
### Difference between ArrayList and HashTable?
<blockquote>
<p>1. <code>ArrayList</code> stores only the value at a particular index while <code>HashTable</code> stores data as Key-Value pair.</p>
<p>2. To access value from <code>ArrayList</code>, index number should be passed while to access value from <code>HashTable</code> key should be passed.</p>
</blockquote>

# Question 4
### Difference between while and for loop?
<blockquote>
<p>Both loops are used when a unit of code needs to execute repeatedly.</p>
<p><code>For loop</code> is used when you know how many times you need to iterate through the code whereas <code>while loop</code> is used when you need to repeat something until a given statement is true.</p>
</blockquote>

# Question 5
### Define Boxing and Unboxing?
<blockquote>
<p>Boxing is converting a value type to an object type.</p>
<p>Unboxing is extracting the value type from the object type.</p>
</blockquote>
  ```C#
  int i =13; 
  object myObject = i; //Boxing-implicit 
  i = (int)myObject; //Unboxing-explicit
  ```

# Question 6
### Difference between Constants and Read-Only variables?
<blockquote>
<p>1. <code>Constants</code> are evaluated compile-time while <code>Read-Only variables</code> are evaluated at runtime.</p>
<p>2. <code>Constants</code> only support value-type variables while <code>Read-Only variables</code> can hold reference type variables.</p>
<p>3. <code>Constants</code> should be used when the value won't change during runtime while <code>Read-Only variables</code> are used mostly when their actual value is unknown before the runtime.</p>
</blockquote>

# Question 7
### Difference between == and Equals()?
<blockquote>
<p>1. <code>==</code> is the comparison operator while <code>Equals()</code> compares the contents of a String.</p>
<p>2. <code>==</code> compares the reference identity as well as the contents while <code>Equals()</code> compares only the contents.</p>
</blockquote>

# Question 8
### Difference between Finalize and Dispose?
<blockquote>
<p>1. <code>Finalize</code> is used to free unmanaged resources like files, database connections, etc held by an object before that object is destroyed. Internally, it is called by Garbage Collector & can't be called by user code while <code>Dispose</code> is used to free unmanaged resources at any time. Explicitally, it is called by user code.</p>
<p>2. <code>Finalize</code> belongs to the Object class while <code>Dispose</code> belongs to IDisposable interface and the class which is implementing Dispose method must implement this interface.</p>
</blockquote>

# Question 9
### What is the default access for a class & the default access for members?
<blockquote>
<p>The default access for a class is Internal & the default access for members is Private.</p>
</blockquote>

# Question 10
### Can multiple catch blocks be executed in c#?
<blockquote>
<p>No. We can use multiple catch blocks with every try but when an Exception is thrown by the debugger, it tries matching the exception type with their signature and catch the exception by the particular catch block, so we can use multiple catch blocks but only one catch can be executed at once.</p>
</blockquote>
```C#
    try {  
            Console.WriteLine("Sample Data");  
        } catch (NullPointerException ex) {  
            Console.WriteLine("NullPointerException");  
        } catch (Exception e) {  
            Console.WriteLine("Exception");  
        }
  ```

# Question 11
### Can 'this' keyword be used within a static method?
<blockquote>
<p>
'this' keyword can't be used in static methods because it returns a reference to the current instance of the class containing it. Static methods can't be instantiated, so they are called by the name of a class and not by instance. Therefore, we canâ€™t use 'this' keyword in the body of static methods.</p>

<p>
By definition, 'this' keyword is a special type of reference variable that is implicitly defined within each constructor and non-static method as a first parameter of the type class in which it is defined.
</p>
